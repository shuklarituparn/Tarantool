Tarantool Version Information: This line indicates the version of Tarantool you're running, which is "2.11.1-0-g96877bd35"
in this case. It also mentions the platform, which is "Linux-x86_64-RelWithDebInfo."

Log Level: The line "log level 5" indicates that the server is running with log level 5. Log levels are used to control
the verbosity of logs, with higher numbers indicating more detailed logs.

Wal/Engine Cleanup: This line mentions that the "wal/engine cleanup is paused." This typically refers to the Write-Ahead
Log (WAL) engine, which is used for durability and crash recovery in Tarantool.

Memory Mapping: These lines indicate that Tarantool is mapping memory for the Memtx and Vinyl storage engines. Memtx and
 Vinyl are storage engines used in Tarantool for different purposes.

Replication Configuration: The lines starting with "update replication_synchro_quorum" indicate that the replication
 configuration is being updated. Replication settings control how data is replicated across multiple instances of Tarantool.

Instance UUID: This line shows the unique identifier (UUID) for this Tarantool instance. It's used to uniquely identify
 this instance within a cluster.

Binding to IP and Port: The line "tx_binary: bound to 0.0.0.0:3301" indicates that Tarantool has successfully bound to
the IP address 0.0.0.0 (which means it's listening on all available network interfaces) and port 3301. This is the address
and port where clients can connect to the Tarantool server.

Initializing Data Directory: This line indicates that Tarantool is initializing an empty data directory. Tarantool stores
its data in a specified data directory.

Replica ID: The line "assigned id 1 to replica" shows that the Tarantool instance has been assigned the replica ID 1.
This is important for replication in a cluster setup.

Cluster UUID: This line shows the unique identifier (UUID) for the cluster. Each cluster has a unique identifier to
 distinguish it from other clusters.

Snapshot Information: These lines indicate that Tarantool is creating a snapshot of its data. Snapshots are periodic
backups of the data.

Ready to Accept Requests: The line "ready to accept requests" indicates that the Tarantool server is fully initialized
and is now ready to accept client requests.

Checkpoint Daemon: The line "scheduled next checkpoint" indicates that the checkpoint daemon has scheduled the next
checkpoint operation. Checkpoints are used to optimize the storage and durability of data.
